## What's a dashboard?

- A communications tool for status and information
- Layout fills available space via subdivision
- High-level trends and summaries favored over details
- Information designed for quick, glancing consumption

## Why build one with R?

- Reproducible; bundles analysis with presentation and communication
- Eliminate the middleman; empower analysts to produce executive-grade dashboards
- Virtually infinite customizability

# Introducing flexdashboard

## What is flexdashboard?

- R package designed to produce beautiful dashboards easily
- Built on R Markdown
- Expresses the structure of a dashboard declaratively using Markdown
- Bundles common dashboard user interface components

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexdashboard", type = "source")
```

# Getting Started

## Via RStudio

## Via the R prompt

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("dashboard.Rmd", 
                 template = "flex_dashboard", 
                 package = "flexdashboard")
```

# Dashboard Layout

## Level three: boxes.


    ### This is a box. 
    
    This is some text in the box.

## Level two: columns


    ## My first column
    
    ### My first box
    
    This is some text in a box.
    
    ## My second column
    
    ### My second box
    
    This is some slightly different text in a box.
    
## Level two: columns

## Level one: pages

    # Page one
    
    ### My first box
    
    This is some text in a box.
    
    # Page two
    
    ### My second box
    
    This is some slightly different text in a box.

## Level one: pages

## Layout Recap:

- flexdashboards are composed of space-filling boxes created with level 3 headers (`###`)
- Boxes can be grouped into columns (or rows, or tabs) with level 2 headers (`##`)
- Pages can group other kinds of components
- Much more advanced layout is possible (see docs for details)

# Components

## Plots and HTML widgets

- Any R graphics are supported
- Graphs and visualizations: the basic building blocks of most dashboards
- Contents automatically scaled to the size of the box
- HTML widgets can include interactivity 

## Plots and HTML widgets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species)
```
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```

## Value boxes

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
articles <- 204
valueBox(articles, 
         icon = "fa-pencil", 
         caption = "Articles per Day")
```

![valuebox](valuebox.png)

## Gauges
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
satisfaction <- 86
gauge(satisfaction, min = 0, max = 100, symbol = '%', 
  label = "Satisfaction", gaugeSectors(
  success = c(80, 100), warning = c(40, 79), danger = c(0, 39)
))
```

# Interactive Dashboards

## Interactivity with HTML widgets

- Simplest form of interactivity
- Static HTML; special client or server requirements
- Data must be fixed (can't run R code)
- Most widgets can't interact with each other 

## HTML widget interactivity demo

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
lungDeaths <- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
dygraph(lungDeaths) %>% 
   dyRangeSelector()
```

## Interactivity with Shiny

- More advanced interactivity
- Components can react to each other 
- R expressions can be evaluated in response to interaction
- Deployment requires Shiny server or shinyapps.io

## flexdashboard vs. shinydashboard

- Static host vs. Shiny Server (or shinyapps.io)
- Simplicity vs. complexity
- Constraints vs. flexibility
